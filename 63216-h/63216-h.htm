<h2 class="nobreak" id="WEST_INDIES">WEST INDIES.</h2>

</div>

<p>A denomination under which is comprehended a large
chain of islands, extended in a curve from the Florida shore
on the northern peninsula of America, to the Gulf of Venezuela
on the southern. These islands belong to five European
powers, viz. Great Britain, Spain, France, Holland
and Denmark. An inhabitant of New England can form
no idea of the climate and the productions of these islands.
Many of the particulars that are here mentioned, are peculiar
to them all.</p>

<p>The climate in all the West India Islands is nearly the
same, allowing for those accidental differences, which the
several situations and qualities of the lands themselves
produce; as they lie within the tropic of Cancer, and the
sun often is almost at the meridian, over their heads, they
are continually subjected to a heat that would be intolerable,
but for the trade winds, which are so refreshing, as to
enable the inhabitants to attend to their concerns, even under
a noon-day sun: as the night advances, a breeze begins
to be perceived, which blows smartly from the land, as it
were, from the centre towards the sea, to all points of the
compass at once. The rains make the only distinction of seasons
in these islands. The trees are green the year round;
they have no cold, or frost; our heaviest rains are but dews,
comparatively: with them, floods of water are poured from
the clouds. About May, the periodical rains from the
South may be expected. After then the tropical summer
in all its splendor. The nights are calm and serene, the
moon shines more brightly than in New England, as do the
planets, and the beautiful galaxy. From the middle of August
to the end of September, the heat is most oppressive,
the sea breeze is interrupted, and calms warn the inhabitants
of the periodical rains; which fall in torrents about
the beginning of October.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="JAMAICA">JAMAICA,</h2>

</div>

<p>The most considerable and valuable of the British West
India Islands, lies between the 75th and the 79th degrees
of west longitude from London, and between 17 and 18
north latitude; it is of an oval figure, 150 miles long, from
East to West, and about 60 miles broad in the middle, containing
4,080,000 acres. An elevated ridge, called the Blue
Mountains, runs lengthwise from East to West, whence
numerous rivers take their rise on both sides. The year is
distinguished into two seasons, wet and dry. The months
of July, August and September are called the hurricane
months. The best houses are generally built low, on account
of the hurricanes and earthquakes; and the colored
people’s huts made of reeds, will hold only two or three
persons. However pleasant the sun may rise, in a moment
the scene may be changed, a violent storm will suddenly
arise, attended with thunder and lightning, the rain falls in
torrents, and the seas and rivers rise with terrible destruction.
I witnessed this awful scene in June last at Kingston,
the capital of Jamaica; the foundations of many houses
were destroyed; the waters, as they rushed from the mountains,
brought with them the produce of the earth, large
branches of trees, and their fruit together; many persons
were drowned endeavoring to reach their homes from their
various occupations; those who reached their homes were
often obliged to travel many miles out of their usual way.
Many young children without a parent’s care, were at this
time destroyed. A poor old woman speaking of these
calamities to the writer, thus expressed herself, “not so bad
now as in the time of slavery, then God spoke very loud to
<i>Bucker</i> (the white people) to let us go. Thank God, ever
since that, they give us up, we go pray, and we have it
not so bad like as before.” I would recommend this poor
woman’s remark to the fair sons and daughters of America,
the land of the pilgrims. “Then God spoke very loud.”
May these words be engraved on the post of every door;
in this land of New England God speaks very loud, and
while his judgments are in the earth, may the inhabitants
learn righteousness! The mountains that intersect this Island
seem composed of rocks thrown up by frequent earthquakes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
or volcanoes. These rocks, though having little
soil, are adorned with a great variety of beautiful trees,
growing from the fissures, which are nourished by frequent
rains, and flourish in perpetual spring. From these mountains
flow a vast number of small rivers of pure water,
which sometimes fall in cataracts, from stupendous heights;
these, with the brilliant verdure of the trees, form a most
delightful landscape. Ridges of smaller mountains are on
each side of this great chain; on these, coffee grows in great
abundance; the valleys or plains between these ridges, are
level beyond what is usually found in similar situations.
The highest land in the Island is Blue mountain Peak,
7150 feet above the sea. The most extensive plain is 30
miles long and 5 broad. Black river, in the Parish of St.
Elizabeth, is the only one navigable; flat-boats bring down
produce from plantations about 30 miles up the river.
Along the coast, and on the plains the weather is very hot;
but in the mountains, the air is pure and wholesome; the
longest days in summer are about thirteen hours, and the
shortest in winter about eleven. In the plains are found
several salt fountains, and in the mountains, not far from
Spanish Town, is a hot bath of great medicinal virtues;
this gives relief in the complaint called the dry bowels malady,
which, excepting the bilious and yellow fevers, is one
of the most terrible distempers of Jamaica. The general
produce of this Island is sugar, rum, molasses, ginger, cotton,
indigo, pimento, cocoa, coffees, several kinds of woods,
and medicinal drugs. Fruits are in great plenty, as oranges,
lemons, shaddocks, citrons, pomegranates, pine-apples,
melons, pompions, guavas, and many others. Here are
trees whose wood, when dry, is incorruptible; here is found
the wild cinnamon tree, the mahogany, the cabbage, the
palm, yielding an oil much esteemed for food and medicine.
Here too is the soap tree, whose berries are useful in washing.
The plantain is produced in Jamaica in abundance,
and is one of the most agreeable and nutritious vegetables
in the world: it grows about four feet in height, and the
fruit grows in clusters, which is filled with a luscious sweet
pulp. The Banana is very similar to the plantain, but not
so sweet. The whole Island is divided into three counties,
Middlesex, Surry, and Cornwall, and these into six towns,
twenty parishes, and twenty-seven villages.</p>

<p>This Island was originally part of the Spanish Empire
in America, but it was taken by the English in 1656.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Cromwell had fitted out a squadron under Penn and Venables,
to reduce the Spanish Island of Hispaniola, but there
this squadron was unsuccessful, and the commanders, of
their own accord, to atone for this misfortune, made a descent
on Jamaica, and having arrived at St. Jago, soon
compelled the whole Island to surrender. Ever since, it
has been subject to the English, and the government, next
to that of Ireland, is the richest in the disposal of the crown.
Point Royal was formerly the capital of Jamaica, it stood
upon the point of a narrow neck of land, which towards the
sea, forms part of the border of a very fine harbor of its
own name. The conveniences of this harbor, which was
capable of containing a thousand sail of large ships, and of
such depth as to allow them to load and unload with the
greatest ease, weighed so much with the inhabitants, that
they chose to build their capital on this spot, although the
place was a hot dry sand, and produced none of the necessaries
of life, not even fresh water. About the beginning
of the year 1692, no place for its size could be compared
to this town for trade, wealth, and an entire corruption of
manners. In the month of June in this year, an earthquake
which shook the whole Island to the foundation, totally
overwhelmed this city, so as to leave, in one quarter,
not even the smallest vestige remaining. In two minutes
the earth opened and swallowed up nine-tenths of the houses,
and two thousand people. The waters gushed out
from the openings of the earth, and tumbled the people on
heaps: some of them had the good fortune to catch hold of
beams and rafters of houses, and were afterwards saved by
boats. Several ships were cast away in the harbor, and
the Swan Frigate, which lay in the Dock, was carried over
the tops of sinking houses, and did not overset, but afforded
a retreat to some hundreds of people, who saved their
lives upon her. An officer who was in the town, at that
time, says the earth opened and shut very quick in some
places, and he saw several people sink down to the middle,
and others appeared with their heads just above ground,
and were squeezed to death. At Savannah above a thousand
acres were sunk with the houses and people in them,
the places appearing, for some time, like a lake; this was
afterwards dried up, but no houses were seen. In some
parts mountains were split, and at one place a plantation
was removed to the distance of a mile. The inhabitants
again rebuilt the city, but it was a second time, ten years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
after, destroyed by a great fire. The extraordinary convenience
of the harbor tempted them to build it once more,
and once more in 1722, it was laid in rubbish by a hurricane,
the most terrible on record. Such repeated calamities
seemed to mark out this spot as a devoted place; the
inhabitants therefore resolved to forsake it forever, and to
reside at the opposite bay where they built Kingston, which
is now the capital of the Island. In going up to Kingston,
we pass over the part of and between Port Royal, leaving
the mountains on the left, and a small town on the right.
There are many handsome houses built there, one story
high, with porticoes, and every convenience for those who
are rich enough to live in them. Not far from Kingston
stands Spanish Town, which though at present is inferior
to Kingston, was once the capital of Jamaica, and is still
the seat of Government. On the 3d of October, 1780, there
was a dreadful hurricane, which overwhelmed the little
sea-port town of Savannah la mer, in Jamaica, and part of
the adjacent country: very few houses were left standing,
and a great number of lives were lost, much damage was
done also, and many lives lost in other parts of the Island.
The same writer says, the misery and hardships of the
slaves were truly moving; the ill treatment which they received
so shortened their lives, that there is no natural increase
of their numbers; many thousand are annually imported
to supply the place of those who pine and die with
the hardships which they receive. It is said, that they are
stubborn, and must be ruled with a rod of iron: it must
be borne in mind, that their tyrants are themselves the
dregs of the English nation, and the refuse of the jails of
Europe. In January, 1823, a Society was formed in London,
for mitigating and gradually abolishing slavery,
throughout the British dominions, called the Anti-Slavery
Society. His Royal Highness, the Duke of Gloucester, was
President of the Society, in the list of vice-presidents are
the names of many of the most distinguished philanthropists
of the day, and among them, that of the never to be
forgotten Mr. Wilberforce; as a bold champion, we see
him going forward, pleading the cause of our down trodden
brethren. In the year 1834, it pleased God to break
the chains from 800,000 human beings that had been held
in a state of personal slavery; and this great event was effected
through the instrumentality of Clarkson, Wilberforce,
and other philanthropists of the day. The population of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Jamaica is nearly 400,000, that of Kingston, the capital,
40,000. There are many places of worship of various denominations,
namely, church of England, and of Scotland,
Wesleyan, the Baptists and Roman Catholics, besides a
Jewish Synagogue. These all differ from those in New
England, and from those I have seen elsewhere. The
Baptists hold what they call class-meetings. They have
men and women, deacons and deaconesses in these churches;
these hold separate class-meetings, some of these can
read and some cannot. These are the persons who hold
the office of judges, and go round and urge the people to
come at the class, and after they come in twice or three
times they are considered candidates for baptism. Some
pay fifty cents, and some more, for being baptized. The
churches take nothing after they are baptized, they receive
a ticket as a passport into the church, paying one mark, a
quarter, or more, and some less, but nothing short of tenpence,
that is, two English shillings a year. They must
attend their class once a week, and pay three pence a week,
total twelve English shillings a year, besides the sums
they pay once a month at communion, after service in the
morning. On those occasions the minister retires, and the
deacons examine the people to ascertain if each one has
brought a ticket, if not, they cannot commune; after this,
the minister returns and performs the ceremony, then they
give their money, and go. The churches are very large,
holding from four to six thousand, many bring wood and
other presents to their class-leader as a token of their attachment;
where there are so many communicants, these
presents, and the money exacted, must greatly enrich these
establishments. I know two who have left their homes to
live with their class-leaders, in order to have her prayers;
most of the communicants are so ignorant of the ordinance
that they join the church merely to have a decent burial;
for if they are not members none will follow them to the
grave, no prayers will be said over them; these are borne
through the streets by four men, the coffin a rough box;
not so if they are church members; as soon as the news
spreads that one is dying, all the class with their leader will
assemble at the place, and join in singing hymns; this,
they say, is to help the spirit up to glory; this exercise
sometimes continues all night, in so loud a strain, that it is
seldom that any can sleep in the neighborhood.—The next
day they bury their dead, the corpse is borne by four bearers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
some of the deacons preceding, and a great company
of men and women following, the women first, dressed in
white, with a strip of white cotton bound round the head,
and falling to the ground. After they have buried their
dead, the company return to the house and have a regular
wake: they believe the spirit of the deceased is present
with them for nine days, and they leave a place for them
at the table, and pay them all the attention they give to
the visible guests.</p>

<p>There is in Jamaica an institution, established in 1836,
and called the Mico Institution; it is named after its founder,
Madame Mico, who left a large sum of money to purchase,
(or rather to ransom, the one being a Christian
act, the other a sin against the Holy Ghost, who expressly
forbids such traffic;) thus having corrected myself, I will resume.
Madame Mico left this money to ransom the English
who were in bondage to the Algerines; if there were
any left, it was to be devoted to the instruction of the colored
people in the British Islands; at this institution, six
adults, men and women, are prepared for teachers. Whole
number taught since the commencement 485—there is a
day school for children, 29 is the regular number—whole
number 2,491—Sabbath Schools 9, whole number taught
6,654—the adults and the Sunday scholars have to pay one
Mack a month. Besides the Mico establishment, there
are in Jamaica 27 Church Missionary Schools, where
2,461 children are taught gratis. Adult schools, 5—whole
number taught, 475. Sabbath Schools 14—whole number
taught, 1,952. London Missionary Society Schools, 16—whole
number taught not ascertained. National Schools,
38—whole number taught, 2,500.</p>

<p>The Wesleyan, Presbyterian and Moravian schools, besides
these; it is supposed there are private schools where
three or four thousand are educated in the city of Kingston,
and twice that number in the streets, without the means of
education. All the children and adults taught in the above
named schools, are taxed £1 a year, except the English
Church school, this is the most liberal. The Rev. Mr.
Horton, a Baptist minister in Kingston, told me he had sent
90 children away from the Baptist school, because they
did not bring their money. It is sufficient to say they had
it not to bring!</p>

<p>Most of the people of Jamaica are emancipated slaves,
many of them are old, worn out, and degraded. Those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
who are able to work, have yet many obstacles to contend
with, and very little to encourage them; every advantage is
taken of their ignorance; the same spirit of cruelty is opposed
to them as held them for centuries in bondage; even
religious teaching is bartered for their hard earnings,
while they are allowed but 33 cents a day, and are told if
they will not work for that, they shall not work at all; an
extortionary price is asked of them for every thing they
may wish to purchase, even their Bibles are sold to them at
a large advance on the first purchase. Where are their
apologists, if they are found wanting in the strict morals
that Christians ought to practice? Who kindly says forgive
them when they err? “forgive them, this is the bitter
fruit of slavery.” Who has integrity sufficient to hold
the balance when these poor people are to be weighed?
Yet their present state is blissful compared with slavery.
Many of the farmers bring their produce twenty or thirty
miles. Some have horses or poneys, but most of them
bring their burdens on their heads. As I returned from
St. Andrews mountain, where I had been sent for by a Mr.
Rose, I was overtaken by a respectable looking man, on
horseback; we rode about ten miles in company. The story
he told me of the wrongs he and his wife had endured
while in slavery, are too horrible to narrate. My heart
sickens when I think of it. He asked me many questions,
such as where I came from? why I came to that Island?
where had I lived? &amp;c.—I told him I was sent for by one
of the missionaries to help him in his school. Indeed, said
he, our color need the instruction. I asked him why the
colored people did not hire themselves?—we would be very
glad to, he replied, but our money is taken from us so fast
we cannot. Sometimes they say we must all bring 1 £; to
raise this, we have to sell at a loss, or to borrow, so that we
have nothing left for ourselves, the macaroon hunters take
all—this is a nickname they give the missionaries and the
class-leaders—a cutting sarcasm this! Arrived at a tavern
about a mile from Kingston, I bade the man adieu, and
stopped for my guide. The inn-keeper kindly invited me
in. He asked me several questions. I asked him as many.
How do the people get along said I, since the emancipation?
The negroes, he replied, will have the Island in
spite of the devil. Do not you see how they live, and how
much they can bear? we cannot do so. This man was
an Englishman, with a large family of mulatto children.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
In May, the 18th, I attended the Baptist missionary meeting
in Queen St. Chapel. The house was crowded. Several
ministers spoke of the importance of sending the gospel
to Africa; they complimented the congregation on their
liberality the last year, when they gave one hundred pounds
sterling; they hoped this year they would give five hundred
pounds, as there were five thousand members at the
present time. There was but one colored minister on the
stand. It is generally the policy of these missionaries to
have the sanction of colored ministers, to all their assessments
and taxes. The colored people give more readily,
and are less suspicious of imposition, if one from themselves
recommends the measure. This the missionaries understand
very well, and know how to take advantage of it.
Wednesday, June 22d and 23d, the colored Baptists held
their missionary meeting, the number of ministers, colored
and mulattoes was 18, the colored magistrates were present.
The resolutions that were offered were unanimously accepted,
and every thing was done in love and harmony.—After
taking up a contribution, they concluded with song
and prayer, and returned home, saying jocosely, they would
turn macaroon hunters.—Mack is the name of a small coin
in circulation at Jamaica. I called, on my return, at the
market and counted the different stalls. For vegetables and
poultry, 196, all numbered, and under cover; besides 70 on
the ground. These are all attended by colored women.
The market is conveniently arranged, as they can close the
gates and leave all safe. There are 19 stalls for fresh
fish, 18 for pork, 30 for beef, 18 for turtle. These are all
regular built markets, and all kept by colored men and women.
These are all in one place. Besides, others may
be found, as with us, all over the city. Thus it may be
hoped, they are not the lying, stupid set of beings they
have been called, but are enterprising and quick in their
perceptions, determined to possess themselves, and to possess
property besides, and quite able to take care of themselves.
They wished to know why I was so inquisitive
about them, I told them we have heard in America that
you are lazy, and that emancipation has been no benefit to
you; I wish to inform myself of the truth respecting you,
and give a true representation of you on my return. Am I
right? More than two hundred people were around me listening
to what I said. They thanked me heartily, I gave
them some tracts, and told them if it so pleased God, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
would come back to them, and bring them some more
books, and try what could be done with some of the poor
children to make them better. I then left them, and went
to the East market, where there are thousands of all kinds
and nations. The Jews and Spanish looked at me very
black. The colored people gathered around me, I gave
them little books and tracts, and told them I hoped to see
them again.</p>

<p>There are in this street upwards of a thousand, young
women and children, living in sin of every kind. From
thence, I went to the gaol, where were 17 men, but no women—in
the house of correction were three hundred culprits.
They are taken from there to work on plantations.
Then I went to the admiral’s house, where the emigrants
find a shelter until they can find employment, then
they work and pay for their passage. Many leave their
homes and come to Jamaica, under the impression that
they are to have their passage free, and, on reaching the
Island, are to be found until they can provide for themselves.
How the mistake originated, I am not able to say,
but on arriving here, strangers, poor, and unacclimated, the
debt for passage-money is hard and unexpected; it is remarkable
that wherever they come from, whether fresh
from Africa, from the other Islands, from the South or
from New England, they all feel deceived on this point.
I called on many Americans and found them poor and discontented,
rueing the day they left their country, where,
notwithstanding many obstacles, their parents had lived and
died, which they had helped to conquer with their toil and
blood.</p>

<p>“Now shall their children stray abroad and starve in
foreign lands.”—I left America November 16th, 1840, in
the ship Scion, Captain Mansfield, bound for Jamaica,
freighted with ice and machinery for the silk factory.
There were on board a number of handicraft-men and other
passengers. We sailed on Monday afternoon, from
Charlestown, Mass. It rained continually until Saturday.
Sunday the 23d was a fine day. Mr. De Grass, a young
colored clergyman, was invited to perform divine service,
which he did with much propriety; he spoke of the dangers
we had escaped, and the importance of being prepared to
meet our God, (he died of fever about three weeks after arriving
at Jamaica,) some who were able to attend came on
deck and listened to him with respect, while others seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
to look on in derision; these spent the afternoon and evening
in card-playing. About twelve at night, a storm commenced;
on Monday we were in great peril; the storm continued
until Friday the 27th. On that day a sail was seen
at some distance making towards us, the captain judging
her to be a piratical vessel, ordered the women and children
below, and the men to prepare for action—the pirates
were not inclined to hazard an engagement; when they saw
the deck filled with armed men they left us. Thus were
we preserved from the storm and from the enemy. Sabbath,
29th, divine service, our attention was directed to the
goodness of God in sparing us.</p>

<p>Monday,—and are we mortals still alive. Tuesday,—Thus
far the Lord has led us on. Wednesday.—Thus far
his power prolongs our days. Thursday—December 3d,
to-day made Turks Island. Friday.—This day had a view
of Hayti, its lofty mountains presented a sublime prospect.
Saturday—a glance we had of Cuba. Sunday—December
6th, at six o’clock in the evening, dropped anchor at St. Anne
harbor Jamaica. We blessed the Lord for his goodness,
in sparing us to see the place of our destination; and
here I will mention my object in visiting Jamaica. I hoped
that I might aid (in some small degree) to raise up and encourage
the emancipated inhabitants, and teach the young
children to read and work, to fear God and put their trust
in their Savior. Mr. Whitmarsh and his friend came on
board and welcomed us. On Tuesday we went on shore
to see the place and the people; my intention had been to
go directly to Kingston, but the people urged me so to stay
with them that I thought it my duty to comply, and wrote
to Mr. Ingraham to that effect. I went first to see the minister,
Mr. Abbot, thought, as he was out, I had better wait
his return. The people promised to pay me for my services
for them, or to send me to Kingston. When Mr. Abbot
returned he made me an offer I readily accepted.—As I
lodged in the house of one of the class-leaders, I attended
her class a few times, when I learned the method, I stopped.
She then commenced her authority, and gave me to understand
if I did not comply, I should not have any pay from
that society. I spoke to her of the necessity of being born
of the spirit of God, before we became members of the
church of Christ, and told her I was sorry to see the people
blinded in such a way. She was very angry with me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
and soon accomplished her end, by complaining of me to the
minister, and I soon found I was to be dismissed, unless I
would yield obedience to this class-leader. I told the minister
that I did not come there to be guided by a poor foolish
woman. He then told me that I had spoken something
about the necessity of moral conduct in church members.
I told him I had, and in my opinion I was sorry to see it so
much neglected. He replied, that he hoped I would not
express myself so except to him; they have the gospel, he
continued, and let them come into the church. I do not approve
of women societies; those destroyed the world’s convention;
the American women have too many of them.
We talked one hour. He paid me for the time I had
been there; I continued till Jan. with the same opinion that
something must be done for the elevation of the children,
and it is for that I labor. On the Sabbath the minister
from the pulpit spoke unkindly of me. This was in January.
I am sorry to say the meeting house is more like a
play house, than a place of worship. The pulpit stands
about the middle of the building, behind are about six hundred
children that belong to the society; there they are
placed for Sabbath School, and there they remain until service
is over, playing all the time. The house is crowded
with the aged and the young, the most part of them bare-footed.
Some have on bonnets, but most of the women
wear straw hats such as our men wear. I gave several
Bibles away, not knowing that I was hurting the ministers’
sale, the people buy them of him at a great advance. I
gave up my school at St. Ann, and on the 18th of March
departed for Kingston, but took the fever and was obliged
to remain until the 7th of April. The people of St. Ann
fulfilled their promise which they made, to induce me to
stop with them—on the 11th of April I arrived at Kingston;
and was conducted to the Mico institution, where Mr. Ingraham
directed me to find him; he had lost his pulpit and
his school, but Mr. Venning the teacher kindly received me.
I stayed there longer than expected; the next morning he
kindly sent one of the young men with me to the packet
for my baggage. I then called on the American Consul,
he told me he was very glad to see me for such a purpose
as I had in view in visiting Jamaica, but he said it was a
folly for the Americans to come to the Island to better their
condition; he said they came to him every day praying him
to send them home. He likewise mentioned to me the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
great mortality amongst the emigrants. This same day I
saw Mr. O——, one of our missionaries, who wished me
to accompany him forty miles into the interior of the country.
This same day I saw Mr. Henshaw. On Saturday
the 17th I received a letter from Fem Hill, in the county
of St. Andrews, to come and assist Mr. Ross in one of the
Mico schools; they sent for me and I went to see them, but
took no part in the school. I saw Mr. Henshaw there.
The day he left Jamaica for the United States, I begged him
to tell the colored people of America not to go to Jamaica,
for they would find themselves deceived. After a week I
returned to Kingston with my mind fully settled what to
do. I spent three weeks at the Mico establishment, and
three weeks with my colored friends from America. On
the 21st of April, I called to see Mr. Horton, a minister.
He was much surprised to see me, and had much to say
about my color, and showed much commiseration for my
misfortune at being so black. My personal narrative I
have placed last in this pamphlet, as of least consequence.
I flatter myself my voyage to Jamaica has not been in vain.
A door of usefulness seems opened to me there, with a zealous
friend. And with the aid of the benevolent, I propose
to establish at Kingston, or in the vicinity, an asylum for
the orphan and the out-cast, where they may be taught
without money and without price. To effect this, I have
returned to this country to solicit aid, and trust I shall not
ask in vain. The colored people of these United States
are induced to remove to Jamaica, in consequence of the
flattering offers made to them, to induce them to emigrate.
Since my return they have been inquisitive to learn from
me something respecting the place, and the people I have
been among. For these inquiries I have written this book,
that they may have the advantage of what information I
have collected, and knowing the truth, they may no longer
be deceived.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> On <a href="#Page_9">page
9</a>, line 21, it is said that there are six adults
preparing for teachers in the Mico institution; it should have
said 15; and that the whole number of teachers so prepared is
485—but the number is not really known. In this institution
none are received except they can read and write, and bring
good recommendations of their piety. A number have finished,
and are teachers in different parts of the Island.</p>
